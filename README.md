# CWVS-MetaRegression

MCMC implementation of critical window variable selection (CWVS) meta-regression proposed and introduced in Warren et al. (2020) and supplementary materials of Rogne et al. (2024).

# Details of the method

The details of the CWVS Meta-regression method is described in [cwvs_slide.pdf](cwvs_slide.pdf).
